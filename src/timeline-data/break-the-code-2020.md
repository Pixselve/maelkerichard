In this 2020 edition, 126 students from 13 schools in Brittany participated in a series of puzzles written by the technical community of Sopra Steria Rennes. 
Participating for the first time, me, Fabien Goardou and Romain Briend took fourth place in the competition. 
We will be back in force next year to bring the totem pole to our school, ESIR.
