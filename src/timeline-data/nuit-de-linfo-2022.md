My team and I won the ESIR Game Jam 2023 with our game "Thumbthing's Wrong". 
It's a multiplayer game made with Unreal Engine. 
A player is on PC and has to jump from platform to platform and up to 4 players on a mobile web app who have to help (or not) the main player to advance using cards that break the rules of the game.
