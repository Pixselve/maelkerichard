Nuit de l'Info is a national 24-hour programming competition for teams of students. 
The goal is to build an application that follows a theme given by the organization. 
After that, you can opt in to multiple challenges proposed by companies. 
We won the challenge "You will become an export in GitLab CI/CD documentation" by [R2Devops](https://r2devops.io). 
We made a GitLab CI/CD documentation generator.
