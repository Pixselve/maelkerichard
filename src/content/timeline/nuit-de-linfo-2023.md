[Nuit de l'Info](https://www.nuitdelinfo.com) is a national 24-hour programming competition for teams of students.
The goal is to build an application that follows a theme given by the organization.
After that, you can opt in to multiple challenges proposed by companies.

We won the challenges "Where is Waldo?" by [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com) and "SVG on hormones!" by [SFEIR](https://www.sfeir.com/).
